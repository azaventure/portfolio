        <p>
            I completed an internship at an online SaaS start-up designing a tool to coordinate the care
            of patients with long-term illnesses. I learned and used a variety of languages and skills during this time,
            including Java, Groovy, Grails, Git, SSH, and general web development. I also learned how to thrive in an
            AGILE environment and complete tickets to specification. When complete, I deployed to a live dev server.

            I was a technician at a local pharmacy and had many different responsibilities. These included
            filling prescriptions, entering in data of new prescriptions, and processing customer orders. I would also
            help diagnose insurance issues. This job taught me important problem solving skills, as many different

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3><strong><a href="https://azaventure.itch.io/the-door/">The Door</a></strong> — October 2025,
            Games 4 Social Impact 2025</h3>
        <p>
            This game was built for Pitt's annual Games 4 Social Impact game jam, of which the theme was <i>migration</i>. 
            I worked in a group with two other people, and we decided to make a game based around taking a citizenship test, with increasing difficult and 
            strange questions. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The game was built in Unity, and I was the lead developer. I wrote every script for the main game logic and designed
            the interactive "paper" object that the test is taken on. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The test was for a fictional country of which we created and developed the details.
            We then took all of the information we created and compiled it into a handbook that the player can
            use during the game to find the information they need for the test.
            The overall goal was to mimic the feeling of both taking a citizenship test, as well as taking a test 
            when you're unprepared and the stress that accompanies that. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            This game won the <strong>Judge's Choice</strong> award, chosen by the judges as the strongest 
            overall project, and one that exemplifies the theme. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3><strong><a href="https://azaventure.github.io/prislahypertext/">PRISLA Hypertext</a></strong> — April 2024,
            Narrative and Technology</h3>
        <p>
            This an interactive web experience and game I built that takes place on a wiki. The contents are
            based around a fictional organization that contains cryptids and anomalies, inspired by the SCP Foundation.
            The antagonist is an invisible force eating away at the organization's data. I used the tool Twine to create
            this
            and organize all of the articles. I wrote all of the articles myself and developed the UI myself,
            so this project blended my creative writing skills and programming skills.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            At Pitt's 2025 Digital Media & Design Showcase, I won the <strong>Crowd Favorite</strong> award for
            this game, and was a finalist in contention for multiple other awards.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3><strong>InSync</strong> — March 2025, Pitt Design Jam</h3>
        <p>
            I worked in a group for Pitt's inaugural Design Jam. We were given a week to develop a product that would
            accomdate for a variety of user profiles, with the theme of "Smart School". My group developed an app
            prototype
            named InSync that lets professors connect easier to their students and lets students connect easier with
            each
            other, both for studying and for connecting on a personal level. It featured easy creation of events for
            classes
            and an open forum where classmates can communicate in general or about specific assignments.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3><strong><a href="https://github.com/azaventure/TDSA">Tea Dragon Society: Amnesiac</a></strong> — November
            2024, Digital Narrative and Interactive Design</h3>
        <p>
            I worked with a partner to make this game, a side-scroller based on the webcomic Tea Dragon Society.
            We were tasked with making a game based around a children's story, and chose this one due to its queer
            themes.
            The game features characters based on the story and gameplay elements that weave together plot points from
            the
            story. One of our top priorities was making a movement system that felt easy and fun to use.
            We used Unity, Git, and Aseprite to develop the game.
        </p>

                    LOST</a></strong> — February 2024, Introduction to Fiction Writing</h3>
        <p>
            This is a story I wrote for a fiction writing class. It's about a team sent to investigate an anomaly
            where things start to go wrong without them realizing it. It takes place in the same storyworld
            as my previously mentioned game, PRISLA Hypertext.

                    of the Coffee Shop</a></strong> — April 2024, Introduction to Fiction Writing</h3>
        <p>
            This is the second story I wrote for my fiction writing class. It's about a barista who relies on music to
            do work,
            who discovers they're becoming deaf. I developed a playlist to go along with the story, as one of the main
            themes
            was music and its impact.
